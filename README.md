# COP4520 Assignment 1-2

## Description
This program was written for the Concepts of Parallel and Distributed Processing course at the
    University of Central Florida.

Your non-technical manager assigns you the task to find all primes between 1 and
    108. The assumption is that your company is going to use a parallel machine that
    supports eight concurrent threads. Thus, in your design you should plan to spawn 8
    threads that will perform the necessary computation. 

### Approach and Reasoning


## Installation
1. Download and unzip the source files.

## Usage
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Compile the `A1-2.cpp` file using the following command:
    ```bash
    g++ A1-2.cpp -o output
    ```
    Replace `A1-2.cpp` with the name of your C++ file and `output` with the desired name of the executable.
4. Run the compiled file using the following command:
    ```bash
    ./output
    ```
    Replace `output` with the name of the executable you specified in the previous step.
